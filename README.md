# Intellij Minispec Plugin

This is a plugin that adds syntax highlighting for Minispec. I hope it can be useful for students taking 6.004 who want to use Intellij as the editor.

In the current state this plugin has:
- Basic syntax highlighting (Built-in functions, keywords, comments, variables, etc)
- Basic syntax checking based on grammar
- Shortcuts (Commenting out blocks of code)
- Been tested with all labs (and design project) released in the Spring 2020 version of the course

This plugin (and README) is a work in progress and I hope to add other features like (RISC-V ASM highlighting and debugging, Minispec autocomplete, and other quality of life features) when I get more time!

## Basic Installation
1. Download the most recent release (should be a zip file)
2. Go to `Preferences` > `Plugins` > `GEAR ICON` > `Install Plugin from Disk`
3. Select the downloaded zip file for installation
4. Upon restarting Intellij, `.ms` files should be recognized and have highlighting!
